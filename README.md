Solving tasks of the second day of the courses
Implement the FindNthRoot algorithm, which allows us to calculate the nth power root (nâˆˆN) from the real number a by the Newton method with a given accuracy. Develop unit tests (NUnit and / or MS Unit Test) to test the method.

Two integer signed four byte numbers and two positions of bits i and j (i <j) are given. Implement InsertNumber insertion algorithm of inserting bits from the jth to the i-th bit of one number into another so that the bits of the second number occupy positions from bit j to bit i (bits are numbered from right to left). Develop unit tests (NUnit) for testing the method.

Implement the FindNextBiggerNumber method, which takes a positive integer and returns the nearest largest integer consisting of the digits of the original number, and null (or -1), if such a number does not exist. Develop unit tests (NUnit or MS Unit Test) to test the method. Add to the FindNextBiggerNumber method the ability to return the time of finding a given number, considering various language features. Develop unit tests (NUnit or MS Unit Test) to test the method.
