Solving tasks of the second day of the courses
Implement the FindNthRoot algorithm, which allows us to calculate the nth power root (nâˆˆN) from the real number a by the Newton method with a given accuracy. Develop unit tests (NUnit and / or MS Unit Test) to test the method.

Implement the method of "bubble" sorting for an integer array (do not use the methods of the class System.Array) in such a way that it was possible to order the rows of the matrix

1. in the order of increasing (decreasing) sums of elements of rows of the matrix;
2. in order of increasing (decreasing) the maximum elements of rows of the matrix;
3. in order of increasing (decreasing) the minimum elements of rows of the matrix.
